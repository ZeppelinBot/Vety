# Introduction

Vety is a modern TypeScript framework for creating Discord bots,
with a focus on great developer experience and safe defaults.

The primary goals for Vety are:
* **Safety first** — Vety aims to make it easy to write safe code by default
* **Predictability** — Any "magic" within Vety should be easy to reason about, and ideally the magic is left out in the first place
* **Automatic context-awareness** — Guild plugins only have access to the context of the guild (server) they're loaded in by default
* **Extensive built-in functionality** — For common bot requirements

## 🛠 Note

These docs are still a work in progress.
